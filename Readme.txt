Some gameplay mechanics:

NOTES:
set firerate adj to 10 (so they fire at the real rate of their weapons)

Scrap
Scrap is the main currency in the game. It is used to spawn stations and is earned when a wreck is scuttled by the Starbase. They can also be earned by building mining bases on the outer asteroid ring of your home planet. 
The Starbase's scuttle radius is around 60 light seconds, so the wrecks in the asteroid belt from the last war are unreachable.

Spawning turrets
Press [U] to choose the turret selection. There are three turrets to spawn:
Laser Defender
Laser Defenders cost 150 scrap.
Missile Defender
Missile Defenders cost 250 scrap.
Hangar Bay
Hangar Bays cost 500 scrap.
Fighters also cost 10 scrap to build, for a total of 5 maximum. They also start with a free fighter.

The main playership right now is the Opinren Orbital Defender. It can create the mining stations at the outer ring, but be warned, the enemy is not going to let your base or your mining rigs alone.

Economic buildings:
Solar Collectors 
regen energy at 20/sec
Mining station 
Upkeep of 20 energy/5 seconds
Adds 10 scrap for every asteroid in a 50 ls radius
Also constructs miners that 
It costs 10 scrap and 10 energy to build a miner. You get scrap equal to the amount of ore mined by the miner.


Also right now there are 18 waves before you beat the game.

Upgrades:
Ships upgrade the turrets they spawn.
Right now, here are the trees:
The Durkham can upgrade these turrets:
Laser turret
Missile turret
Hangar Bay
The Opinren can upgrade these turrets:
Laser turret
mining rig
solar collector

There's also energy upkeep costs:
The Starbase regens energy at 75/10 sec
Solar Collectors regen energy at 20/sec
Laser defenders cost 5/5sec
	at each level firing a shot costs 1 energy, next weapon upgrade costs 2 energy, etc
Missile defenders cost 10/20sec
These don't require much upkeep, but are slightly weaker.
Mining station 
Upkeep of 20 energy/5 seconds



Fleet Mechanics
Capital Ships
Right now there are three capital ships in the game, two starter ones and one that has to be constructed in-game.
The Durkham is a carrier. It makes most of the offensive turrets in the game and is good at taking down gunships.
The Opinren is a starting ship that makes most of the economy stations.
The Aciman is a capital ship counter, and can take down enemy capital ships with ease. It may have trouble with enemy gunships though.

If you use the [I]nvoke screen you can see all of your available capital ships, and you can invoke the right key to change ships to the right capital ship.
If your capital ship gets destroyed you will be given a second chance and spawn in an escape pod. You can then dock to another capship (or construct one) and pilot that.
If you die in the escape pod or the main starbase dies it's game over.

Economy 
The Opinren makes mining rigs and solar collectors.
The mining rig and solar collectors provides a scuttle radius of 60 light seconds, so anything destroyed within 60 ls of the mining rig will be scuttled.
It also generates scrap every 40 seconds, and gives 10 scrap for every asteroid in a 50 light second radius. You also can't stack mining rigs.

Multiverse
If you'd like, you can comment with your multiverse nick and I can add you as a beta tester and this will auto update (and that way you don't have to download through Xelerus.)

Refueling:
Refueling is also a hassle. I'll make it cost scrap sometime soon, and allow you to install some kind of solar panel array, but right now just dock with the Starbase and refuel for free.

Barricades don't count as taking up location in terms of station placement.
